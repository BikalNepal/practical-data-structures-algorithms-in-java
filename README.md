# Practical Data Structures & Algorithms in Java
[Udemy Online Class](https://www.udemy.com/practical-data-structures-algorithms-in-java)

## Motivation

Learning data structures and algorithms will make me a better computer scientist. This will
afford me new career opportunities. It will help me offer better advice to the students I 
mentor and the customers I serve.

Simple tasks such as merging two arrays of objects can be easily solved in code but can
be fundamentally flawed without a working knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
For example, it's intuitive to solve this problem with a O(n^2) growth rate solution. There 
are far better non-intuitive solutions that become intuitive once you begin thinking in 
these terms.

Over the years, this topic has been calling to me. I've dabbled with it at various points
but I felt it was time to really gain a firm practical working knowledge of DS & Algorithms.

As with anything I learn, I try to take it to the next level and think creatively about the 
problems I'm facing day to day. I'm excited to see what new solutions I come up with by having
a fundamental working knowledge of this topic!

## Course Details

This course takes a practical approach to learning data structures and algorithms. This means
that you spend the majority of the course implementing data structures and algorithms. This
allows you to learn theory through practical application.

The course covers:

- Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
  - Intro to OOP Class & Object, Program Flow, App Runtime, etc.
  - Java behind the scenes: Stack (frames) & Heap (references and storage)
- Data Structures
	- Abstract Data Types
	- Big O Notation
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Linked Lists: Singly, Circular, and Doubly
- Popular Searching and Sorting Algorithms
	- Linear Search, Binary Search
	- Recursion: Intro, Recursive Linear & Binary Search
	- Big O Notation, part 2
	- Selection Sort
	- Insertion Sort
	- Merge Sort
	- Quick Sort
- Advanced Data Structures
